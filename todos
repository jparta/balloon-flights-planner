- If a launch time of interest is chosen, conduct runs of simulations around that launch time with a higher temporal resolution

- Estimate resolution that is possible when imaging the ground based on the flight track of the balloon

- Add a window to create a launch area

- Add a window to create a launch configuration

- Preload weather data and use existing files instead of downloading every time !! check Notion notes on implementation !!

- Alert about good launch windows, when launch weather and landing area are good
